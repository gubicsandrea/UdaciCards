# UdaciCards Project

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React Native course. You can create decks and cards with questions and answers to quiz yourself in a topic. In the main screen you can see all your decks. If you want to add a new deck, just go to the Add Deck tab. After tapping a deck, you can add cards to it or start a quiz with the existing cards. If you want to learn regularly, you can add permission to a daily reminder notification at statup.

## Install

After cloning/downloading the project, install it with _npm install_ then you can start it with _expo start_. You can choose whether you want to run it in an emulator or on a device.
Note: The notifications are shown only when you run it on a device. The app was tested on an **Android** device.
